                I've never had a lot of hobbies, I usually like to keep to myself most of the time and just play video games, so in that case I want to share some of my favorite video game experiences. Most of my favorite games are more of the mainstream titles like Call of Duty, Rainbow Six Siege, and Destiny 1 and 2, but I also like some of the Souls-like games including Dark souls 3 and Elden ring, I have also recently gotten into Monster hunter wilds a couple weeks ago and have been absolutely addicted, so just sharing that I want to get into more depth.
            </p>

                Rainbow six siege was one of my favorite games of all time for a long while. Back when I was about to go into highschool, me and my friends had gotten hooked onto Siege to the point that after school we would all get on and play ranked together. Even though I sucked at the game, we still had a lot of fun, but over time my friends got much better than me. Not saying I was jealous of them being better than me, but eventually they got very serious about the game and wanted to take it more seriously than I ever wanted to. I'm talking like wanting to sign up for tournoments, making strategys for each map, making smurf accounts. It got to the point where I just didn't want to play anymore. So I quit and they went on to get a new teamate. I still like the game, but that experience has tainted the experience for me.

                Call of duty was a game that I've had an on and off relationship with. My first COD was Advanced Warfare, and it definitley has a soft spot in my heart, but that was my frst introduction to the series. There have only been a handful of the games that I haven't bought, like ghosts, ww2, and some of the original games before they went main stream. My enjoyment stems from the simplicity and ability to make a weapon your own. They have gotten the gameplay down to a science, yet it doesn't get old. While I know that the game has it's downsides and some of them are major downsides, they still get the feeling of the game right everytime. My favorite of the newer series has been MW3 2023, despite being reviewed as the worst in the series, the game after a year was in my opinion the best one. They have over 100 weapons to use while most of the games barely get 50 at the end of their life cycle. It has some of the best and most beloved weapons brought into the game from previous titles, a bunch of remastered maps, and some of the most customization the game has ever had. It does suck that something like that won't be recreated due to not many copies sold. Black ops 6 is good, but I do miss a lot of the weapons I had in that game, maybe they'll bring back some of them again.

                Elden ring was my first souls-like game that I had played to the end, I tried dark sould 3 before but I got very frustrated at the game and it's complexity. However, the amount of people that had praised this game, and how many people played it compared to other entries, I felt that I should give it a try. It's unfortunate that I will never get to experience playing this game for the first time again, it was truly a masterpiece. From beginning to end it was an amazing experience. For it being the first open-world souls-like game, the world was absolutely massive. The moment I felt like I got to the end of the map, it kept going on further and further. The bosses were some of the best in the series for how iconic they were, like Rhadan and Melania. To top it all off, when the DLC for the game call "Shadow of the Erdtree came out, it just amplified my love for the game even more. I hope that the next game they make will have the same elements of Elden ring."

                Destiny as a whole has been the game I have played for more than a decade of my life, I first picked it up back during christams of 2014, just a few months after it released. Not only was it my first fps game, it was my first game that had any sort of violence at all, and I turned out ok :D. This game has shaped my life the way it is now, all the memories and the good and the bad times that I have experience in this game has all been worth it, because it never felt like my time has been wasted, if there is one time period I would like to go back to, it would be to go back to the time when I first got this game, and experience the time of being a kid playing with my friends again.
