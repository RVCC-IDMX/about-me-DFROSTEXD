                I wanted to show you guys how to make use of animations in css. It's a very easy process that utilizes keyframes. Keyframes are like checkpoints for an animation that is where an animation will start, let's say for instance that you want to make an animation to have an image move from left to right, you start the keyframe at one area, then make another keyframe with different animation parameters. For example, your original position for an image was on the left side of the website, with the new keyframe that gives it a new position (lets say to the right side) on the screen. When the animation plays, the image will move from the left to the right side in real-time, now there will need to be some other parameters in place, like animation durations, so that the animation doesn't happen instantly, or some other things that you can tweak to make the animation look better. <br>
                What you're seeing below is an example of an animation that invloves css animation tools. If you want to impliment this into the code, follow these steps. What you need to do is to add in a keyframes into the css section named '@keyframes'. While in that section, you can add whatever kind of animation you want, but for this animation I added a rotation animation. The first thing to add is a 'from' keyframe, that has the starting position of the animation set to 0 degrees in rotation, it looks like this when typed out <br>(from {<br>transform: rotate(0deg);<br>}). The next key fram we add is similar, but we us 'to' for the next keyframe to signal to the computer that this is what we want the animation to go to, it looks like this (to {transform: rotate(360deg);}). There is your animation. Now we just have to assign it to an element. To assign it, put the css code named 'animation' into the element you want to be animated with the name of the keyframe assigned to the animation you made. For me it was called 'spin', so just put the word spin or whatever else you called it next to the animation element. Next, we put in the specific settings, it looks like this <br>(#lit figure{ <br>text-align: center; <br>animation: spin 2s linear infinite; <br>transform-origin: center; <br>display: block; <br>margin: auto;}).<br> Let's go over the settings. First we put in the duration, which for me was 2 seconds, then we put in linear to keep a contant speed, and finally we have the infinite to keep the logo spinning forever. Now as we can see the logo is going to be spinning infinitley, of course you can do this with any image you want to and more. Now you know how to make an image rotation animation in css. I hope that you can expand upon this and do more than just a rotation animation! Please feel free to contact me about this in case you can't get it to work, I am always able to talk to anyone who needs help with something like this. Enjoy your new animation!
