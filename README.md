This is my about me project that I have been building since the start of the semester in spring of 2025. I wanted to display the skills that I have learned throughout this semester, and what better way to do that then to make a website about me. If we start from the top we can see a navbar that has 4 buttons to press, one will bring you down to my bio where it will tell you all about me. The next one is the gallery that displays images of certain things that define me and my interests, like the first one where it is a picture of my character from the game 'Destiny 2'. Here I was able to learn how to implement images into my website, and scale them properly. The third one is my blog about css animations, it is where I will exlpain how they work and how to use them properly. The last section is my contact, this is where you can reach out to me if you so please. This is where I learned how to do the most complicated piece of work from the project, making buttons and connecting the submit button to netlify. No I want to move onto the colors for the website. For me I am someone who likes a more low-key kinda style, not to harsh on the eyes and very easy to follow. I feel like the more complex a website it the less people want to interact with it.  So the dark gray for the border and navbar is to direct the viewer to the middle of the website, as to not overwhelm the viewer of places to look.  

Here are some of the websites that I used to create some of my work
